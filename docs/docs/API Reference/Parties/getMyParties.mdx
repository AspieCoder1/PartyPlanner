## Request body
No body needed.

## Headers  
This endpoint does not require any custom headers to be set.

## Success Response
Code: `200` with an array of parties the user hosts.
### Example Response
This is the case where the `jonhSmith1` (username) is in the attendeesID list. Note that this should return an array of JSON objects of the parties they host.
UserID : {'johnSmith1'}
```json
[{
  "party": {
    "attendeesID": [.....,"johnSmith1",....],
    ...
  }
}]
```

## Errors
- `400`, in the case there are parties the user is a host of. This would look like `{code: 400, error_msg: 'You have no host parties at the moment'}`.
- OR in the case of a server error you would get a `500` error in the form of `{code: 5xx, error_msg: 'Oh snap, something went wrong on our end.'}`

## Example request
```js
var axios = require("axios");
axios.get('/api/parties/my-parties', UserID).then(res => {
    console.log(res.body)
}).catch(err => {
    console.log(err)
})
```
